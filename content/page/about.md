### A former blog about open source contributing

This blog started as a place for me to document my efforts and insights from FOSS development and contribution.
This served two purposes.

 * It added searchable information to the internet.
 * It helped me remember the stuff I did and learned.

At the time I worked a lot on [Puppet](https://github.com/ffrank/puppet), later a little bit
on [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt).
I proceeded to fall off the open source bandwagon. But still I think about things,
and will occasionally write about them even.

### Who is that cat?

You can read more about myself over on [my website](https://felix-frank.net).

There you can also find ways to get in touch etc.
