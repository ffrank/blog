When a prominent fellow tech author like [John Arundel](https://twitter.com/bitfield)
offers you to review your title, and even do it in the form of a guest post on your
blog, you will probably find yourself facing the proverbial no-brainer decision.
Or perhaps that's just me. (If it is, you all should probably stop pondering so much
about everyting, though.)

This [review](/page/puppet-essentials-review.html) is so beautifully written, it warms my
heart and fills me with pride (seasoned with a hint of imposter syndrome). Today I feel
like a child who just got a very shiny present.

For all of that and more, I'm truly grateful.
